# Learning C++ with C++ Primer

This repository contains code examples and exercises from the book **"C++ Primer"** by Stanley B. Lippman, Jos√©e Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo. The purpose of this repository is to document my journey of learning C++ and to serve as a reference for others who may be learning C++.

## Contents

The repository is organized by chapters in the book, and each chapter has its own directory. Inside each chapter directory, there are subdirectories for each section of the chapter.

Each section directory contains examples and exercises from the book, as well as any additional notes or code snippets that I find helpful.

## Usage

Feel free to clone this repository and use the code examples and exercises for your own learning purposes. Note that this is not a comprehensive guide to C++, and it should not be used as the sole resource for learning the language.

## Contributing

I am not currently accepting contributions to this repository, as it is intended for my personal learning journey. However, feel free to open an issue if you notice any errors or have suggestions for improvements.

## License

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to the authors of "C++ Primer" for writing such a comprehensive and informative book.
